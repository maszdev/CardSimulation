# CardSimulation
Imagine album for sticker collection, for example my daughter (Zuzia) has album with 192 empty enumerated places 
for (enumerated) stickers with Monster High creatures:-). 
You can buy stickers in foiled boosters, so you don't know which sticker you draw. On the begining almost every sticker is new and you can put 
it in empty place (with the same number as on stick) in album. Later situations occur that you already have this card. On the end 
it's hard to complete missing stickers. 

The question is - how many stickers you need to buy to complete whole album with 192 empty places for 192 different stickers. 

CollectionCardSimulation.py script makes simulation: one iteration is related with experiment - draw random cards untill all places in album are fulfilled. This iteration is repeated 10000 times. 
Minimum value of cards, maximum and average are printed.
